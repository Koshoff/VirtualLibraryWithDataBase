# VirtualLibraryWithDataBase

I have successfully upgraded the virtuallibrary project.
One of the main enhancements I introduced is the implementation of a database,
which allows us to more efficiently store and manage our data.
This will help us work with a larger volume of information and build more complex functionalities.
 I organized the code by adding additional interfaces and classes to implement the methods,
 achieving independence between individual modules.
